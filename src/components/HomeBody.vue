      I am a Software Engineer with strong problem solving and technical skills.
      I enjoy pushing myself to the limit by always learning new technologies
      and refining preexisting skills. I have interests in Web, Cloud and Data
      Science.<br /><br />

      During my education at Appalachian State University, I was exposed to a
      wide variety of programming languages ranging from C and X86 Assembly all
      the way to cutting edge Javascript Frameworks like Vue.js and Node.js. I
      see specific technologies and stacks as means to an end. I am language
      agnostic, but my current stack is MEVN. <br /><br />
      I am a huge fan of Agile!
